\section{Discussion}\label{sec:dttts.discussion}

We presented a way to use Thompson sampling for \gls{bai} for infinitely many-armed bandits and explained how to use it for \gls{hpo}. We introduced the \textit{first fully dynamic algorithm} for this setting and showed through an empirical study that it is a promising approach for \gls{hpo}. 

It would be interesting to establish theoretical guarantees to support the good performance of \gls{dttts}, with the hope to provide a finite-time upper bound on its probability of error. We also plan to investigate variants of this algorithm for the non-stochastic bandits for which \Hyperband{} can be used, which would allow spending more time on the more promising algorithms.

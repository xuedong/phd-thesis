\section{Outline}\label{app:lgc.outline}

The appendices are organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$]
    \item Notation is given in Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.notations}. 
    \item Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.lemmas} is dedicated to some important technical lemmas.
    \item We give a full proof of Theorem~\ref{th:lb_genral} in Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.lower_bound}.
    %\item We list and elaborate in detail several pure exploration problems in Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.examples}.
    \item Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.proof} is dedicated to the proof of sample complexity for the convexified algorithm \LGC.
    \item Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.proof_nc} is dedicated to the proof of sample complexity for the non-convexified algorithm \LG.
    %\item We discuss the tracking procedure in Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.tracking}.
    \item We discuss the stopping rules in Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.stopping}.
    %\item Finally, we provide some further details about the experiments in Appendix~\ref{app:lgc.implem}.
\end{itemize}

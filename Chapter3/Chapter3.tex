\chapter{A Bayesian Study of Best-Arm Identification}\label{CHAP:T3C}
    %\abstract{In Section~\ref{sec:t3c.algorithm}, we give a reminder of \TTTS and introduce \TCC along with our proposed recommendation and stopping rules. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:related}, we describe in detail two important notions of optimality that are invoked in this paper. The main fixed-confidence analysis follows in Section~\ref{sec:t3c.confidence}, and further Bayesian optimality results are given in Section~\ref{sec:bayesian}. Numerical illustrations are given in Section~\ref{sec:t3c.experiments}.}

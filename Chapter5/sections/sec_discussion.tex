\section{Discussion}\label{sec:gpo.discussion}

We studied \PCT, a new instantiation of \POO on top of \HCT. We proved that \HCT is a plausible subroutine for \POO by adapting the analysis of \HCT under a new assumption w.r.t.\,a fixed partitioning. We also proposed \GPO, a general framework for making any hierarchical bandit algorithm that only has a simple regret guarantee adaptive to unknown smoothness. However, whether it is possible to weaken the assumptions of \HOO in the same way as \HCT while keeping similar regret guarantees remains open.
